## Introduction to Statistics
- In the mainstream media and social media, we are constantly bombarded by a lot of data. 

- In everyday language, the term data connotes numerical types of data- population numbers, age, etc. 

- However, much of the data today is unstructured- from the music you listen to on Sportify and YouTube Music, to videos you would watch on Netflix and YouTube. 

## Introduction to Statistics

- How best can we make sense of this data? Statistics is the wing of maths devoted to making sense of data? 

- Note that not all data lends itself to statistical analysis. 

- In this course we examine how statistics allows us to make sense of data. But first, some definitions. 

## Defining statistics 
- The term statistics has several meanings;

- Statistics the subject: Statistics is a way of reasoning, along with a collection of tools and methods, designed to help us understand the world.

- Statistics as values computed: Statistics (plural) are quantities calculated from (sample) data.

## The two types of statistics - Descriptive vs Inferential
- Descriptive statistics is the term given to the analysis of data that helps describe, show or summarize data in a meaningful way such that, for example, patterns might emerge from the data. 

- Descriptive statistics do not, however, allow us to make conclusions beyond the data we have analysed or reach conclusions regarding any hypotheses we might have made. 

- They are simply a way to describe our data.

## The two types of statistics - Descriptive vs Inferential

- For instance, when you get a dataset with height and weight of students in your class and compute averages, variance and standard deviation.

- HERE You are simply describing the data and NOT using it to make conclusions about the height and weight of ALL students at Karatina university.

## The two types of statistics - Descriptive vs Inferential
- In this level of statistics, we get data from a SAMPLE and use it to make conclusions about the WHOLE population. 

- Usually, we have no access to the entire population and rely on sample data to draw inferences about the population.

- Example of inferential statistics is when you take a sample of 2nd year BPM students at Karatina University, take their height and weight, and use this data as a basis to infer the height and weight of ALL students at Karatina University. 

## Defining data;

- What are data? (singular- datum): Data are qualitative or quantitative values along with their context.

- Modern datasets are so large; think of how much data safaricom collects in a day. Would you store that data in an excel spreadsheet. NO!

- Usually large datasets are stored in vast repositories (databases) called data warehouses, and accessed by advanced tools like SQL. Find out what SQL is!!

## Big Data

- The sheer quantity of data has birthed a new name, big data. 

- Big data are data so vast they cannot be handled using the traditional methods of storage (e.g. excel spreadsheet) and analysis (using SPSS) are inadequate.

## Big Data

- Big data connotes data that accumulates very fast (the velocity problem), 

- Data from many sources and in different varieties- text, video, pictures, sound (the variety problem), 

## Big Data

- Data that in large quantity (the volume problem).

- It is challenging to tell whether or not it is authentic (the veracity problem- think of the modern prevalence of fake news on social media). 

- Think of a dataset with 150 billion rows of data and 1000 columns of variables. wheredo you start analysing that? 

## Data Analytics;

- Many companies are increasingly using past customer data to predict their future purchases, which allows them to serve customers better or target them better with adverts. 

- This process of using data, especially of transactional data (data collected for recording
the companies’ transactions), to make decisions and predictions is sometimes called data mining or predictive analytics. The more general term business analytics (or sometimes simply analytics) describes any use of data and statistical analysis to drive
business decisions from data whether the purpose is predictive or simply descriptive.

## Data context
To make sense of data we need to answer several questions; 

- Who is the data about? Individuals, corporations, machines, etc. 

- What is the data is about? purchase history, weight, blood group, etc. 

## Data context

- When was the data collected? is it still relevant if it was collected 50 years ago?

- Where were the data collected? Is data collected in Somalia relevant to Kenya.

- Why was the data collected? What questions did we have in mind? For tax accounting purposes; For use in targeting adverts to consumers? In short what were your research questions?

## Metadata
- Metadata is data about data. 

- Check the last phone call you made.

- The metadata about the call tells you who you called, when you called, the duration of the call including the data and time, if you ask safaricom they will give you data about where you called from, including a verbatim of what you discussed (the what and why you called). 

## Metadata

- Metadata allows us to aswer the who, what, when, where and why of data.

- Metadata provides the context of the data. 

## Storing data
Usually data are stored in data tables. 

- Most databases are just huge data tables. 

- Rows of the data table represent individual cases. 

- Columns of the data represent the variables- the attributes of each case. 

## Example of a data table
```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(tibble)
library(kableExtra)
library(janitor)
library(tidyverse)
library(rvest)
library(gt)
tribble(~ Name, ~ Age, ~ Height, ~ Weight, ~ County, ~ Date_of_data,
        
        "Atieno", "32", "180", "90", "Mombasa", "Jan 1, 2021", 
        
        "Mogaka", "25", "160", "70", "Laikipia", "Jan 1, 2021",
        
        "Etyang", "18", "200", "74","Narok", "Jan 1, 2021",
        
        "Jeptoo", "22", "150", "55", "Wajir", "Jan 1, 2021",
        
        "Junior", "10", "120", "35", "Samburu", "Jan 1, 2021") %>% 
  
  knitr::kable(caption = "Data about men and women")
```

## Data table
- Each row represents a case. For instance the first row tells us about Atieno, and so on.

- Each row is a record, information about an individual in a database.

## Data table

- Cases go by different names, depending on the situation. Individuals who answer a survey are referred to as `respondents`. People on whom we experiment are `subjects` or (in an attempt to acknowledge the importance of their role in the experiment) `participants`, but animals, plants, websites, and other inanimate subjects are often called `experimental units`. Often we call cases just what they are: for example, customers, economic quarters, or companies. In a database, rows are
called records—in this example, purchase records. Perhaps the most generic term is cases.

## Data table
- The column titles (variable names) tell what has been recorded.

- Each recorded item in the column is called a variable, like name, height, weight etc. 

## Data table

- A general term for a data table like the one shown above is a `spreadsheet`, a name that comes from bookkeeping ledgers of financial information.

- In large datasets many datatables are linked together in a `relational database` like we do in Ms Access. 

## Variable Types
- When the values of a variable are simply the names of categories we call it a categorical, or qualitative, variable. Examples are Name and County in our table. 

- When the values of a variable are measured numerical quantities with units, we call it a quantitative variable. Note they must have units to be quantitative. 

## Variable Types

- BE CAREFUL;

- Your National ID number is NOT quantitative!!!! Does it have units?? If you were to get the mean of the ID Numbers of your family members, how would you interpret it?

- Numbers like ID Numbers are identifier variables, just a special type of categorical or qualitative variables that you could easily confuse as quantitative. 

## Identify qualitative vs categorical (qualitative) variables
- Admission number; 111, 112, 113, 114, 115

## Identify qualitative vs categorical (qualitative) variables

- Height; Short, Medium, Tall, Tall, Short, Median

- Height; 150 cm. 180 cm, 200 cm, 120 cm. 

- Weight: Underweight, Obese, Overweight, Ideal Weight, Overweight.

## Identify qualitative vs categorical (qualitative) variables

- Weight: 60 kg, 170 kg, 90 kg, 75 kg 

- Age; Toddler, teen. teen, young adult, elder.

## Identify qualitative vs categorical (qualitative) variables

- Age; 15 years, 20 years, 17 years.

- Age; 15-20 years, 20-24 years, 50-60 years, 70 years and above. 
- Notice how variables can be presented as qualitative or quantitative (see height/ weight/age). 

## Identify qualitative vs categorical (qualitative) variables
- Don’t label a variable as categorical or quantitative without thinking about the data and what they represent. The same variable can sometimes take on different roles.
- Don’t assume that a variable is quantitative just because its values are numbers. Categories are often given numerical labels. Don’t let that fool you into thinking they have quantitative meaning. Look at the context.

## Identify qualitative vs categorical (qualitative) variables

- Always be skeptical. One reason to analyze data is to discover the truth. Even when you are told a context for the data, it may turn out that the truth is a bit (or even a lot) different. The context colors our interpretation of the data, so those who want to influence what you think may slant the context. A survey that seems to be about all students may in fact report just the opinions of those who visited a fan website. The question that respondents answered may be posed in a way that influences responses.

## Variables types

- Categorical variables can either be ordinal vs nominal.

- Weight; light, medium, heavy, superheavy

- Age; Toddler, Teen, Young adult, Elder.

- Note that these two categorical variables have inherent order; the are ordinal.

- order == ordinal

## Variables types- Ordinal vs Nominal.

- Others have no inherent order, they are Nominal. 

- Examples are gender (male, female); names of cities (Nairobi, Mombasa, Kisumu)

- Look at the county column in the table above, is there order; so are names. 

## Variable types- continous or discrete
- Numeric variables are either continous or discrete.

- Continous variables can take on any value inclusing fractions and zero. 

- Continuous variables are usually measured like height, weight, speed.

## Variable types- continous or discrete

- In many cases, variables like weight are usually shown as whole numbers but in reality can take on any values.

- We mostly present continuous values as discrete because of convenience or lack of precise tools for measuring,

- This problem of presenting continuous variables as discrete is called "discretization". 

## Variable types- continous or discrete

- In reality, may be you are not 21 years old; you could be 21.01 years old if you put in the days, hours, minutes and seconds.

##  Variable types- continous or discrete
- Other numeric variables are discrete- they can only take on whole numbers. 

- Can we have 2.5 students in a class?

- Think of discrete numbers as counts.

## Data Types; Time series, cross-sectional, and logitudinal/ panel data

A time series is an ordered sequence of values of one or more quantitative variables measured at regular intervals over time. Time series are common in business. Typical measuring points are months, quarters, or years, but virtually any consistently-spaced time interval is possible.


## Example: Time series

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(kableExtra)
data.frame(Year = 2010:2020, Salary = seq(10000, 20000, length.out = 11), Weight = runif(11, 80, 90)) %>% 
  kbl(caption = "An example of Time series data") %>% 
  kable_classic(font_size = 12, full_width = FALSE)
```


## Cross sectional data
- For cross-sectional data, several variables are measured at the same time point, see table 1. 

- The data in table 1 was all at a point in time, Jan 1, 2021. 

## Panel data
- Panel data has both a time series element and a cross-sectional element. 

- Research on this. 

## Exercise

I dentify the data types in the following set of data.

```{r}
library(janitor)
library(rvest)
read_html('https://www.worldometers.info/geography/7-continents/') %>% 
  html_nodes('table') %>% 
  html_table() %>% 
  .[[1]] %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(across(
    .cols = -continent & where(is.character),
    .fns = ~parse_number(.x)
  )) %>% 
  kableExtra::kbl(caption = "World Population by Continent",
                  booktabs = TRUE) %>% 
  kable_classic_2(font_size = 10, 
                  full_width = FALSE)
```
